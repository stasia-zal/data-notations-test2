            Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the central processing unit (CPU), random-access memory (RAM), motherboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, and computer case. It includes external devices such as a monitor, mouse, keyboard, and speakers. By contrast, software is a set of written instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware derived its name from the fact it is hard or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is soft because it is easy to change. Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware. Some of the earliest computing devices date back to the seventeenth century. For example, French mathematician Blaise Pascal designed a gear-based device called the Pascaline that could add and subtract. Then, in 1676, the stepped reckoner was invented by Gottfried Leibniz, which could also divide and multiply. Due to the limitations of contemporary fabrication and design flaws, Leibniz' reckoner was not very functional, but similar devices (Leibniz wheel) remained in use into the 1970s. In the 19th century, Englishman Charles Babbage invented the difference engine, a mechanical device to calculate polynomials for astronomical purposes. Babbage also designed a general-purpose computer that was never built. Much of the design was incorporated into the earliest computers: punch cards for input and output, memory, an arithmetic unit analogous to central processing units, and even a primitive programming language similar to assembly language.

                <h3>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h3>
                <p>
                    The CPU is the core of a computer, executing instructions and managing tasks. It processes data for everything from simple applications to complex games. The more cores and higher clock speed it has, the better it can handle multitasking. Modern CPUs often feature multiple cores for better performance in demanding tasks like video editing. It's considered the "brain" of the computer, controlling the flow of data.

                <h3>Motherbard</h3>
                <p>
                    The motherboard connects all hardware components of a computer, allowing them to communicate. It provides slots for the CPU, memory, storage, and peripherals. It also houses the BIOS or UEFI, which manages booting processes. The motherboard determines what kind of components can be used, such as the type of RAM or CPU sockets. Without a motherboard, no hardware could function together.                </p>
